1. Price1 does not accurately represent the expected value
   because the "float" data type cannot be represented exactly
   decimal value 17.96 due to its limitations in the binary system
   represent. All  other samples work as expected
   because the values ​​17.98 and 17.96 are more approximate
   according to data types "float" and "double".

2.
    1: The first example works through implicit coercion,
       where the value "int"  "money" is implicitly converted to
       "double" when divided by "100.0", gives the correct result.
    2: The second example also works through explicit coercion,
       where the value "int"  "money" is explicitly converted to a
       "double" before dividing by "100.0".
    3: The third example works similarly to the second example, using
       explicit coercion by explicitly converting “money” to “double”
       before dividing by "100.0".

3.  A. The value of the “result” variable  is 72 because it is 
       the result of dividing the integer “money” by 100. 
    B. Displayed value:
       1. Sample 1:
       Displays the value 72.00, where implicit
       Promotion occurs as "money" is divided by 100, converted
       the result to a double for proper formatting
       2. Sample 2:
       Displays garbage data because "%d" is used for
       formats a double value, causing undefined behavior.
       3. Sample 3:
       Show value 72.00, using  "result"
       variable,  is an integer that is implicitly promoted to a double
       to format.
       4. Sample 4:
       Displays the value 72 as an integer.

    C. The printf function causes patterns one and three to not  work as
       expected because implicit promotion occurs during formatting. That is
       it is essential to use the correct format specifier ("%lf" for double and
       "%d" for integer) to match the data type of the value you're trying to print.
