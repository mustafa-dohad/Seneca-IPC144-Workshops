\f0\fs80 \cf0 1. I have previous programming experience as I spent a brief amount of time on computer science and studied 2 semesters back in my country, I\'92ve studied C programming and Java in those 2 semesters also on Coursera I have studied Python but right now I\'92m on the basic level.\
\
2. I code on my MacBook and use vs code so initially I had to install a package for compiling such as gcc so in my Mac terminal I type \'93gcc -o <filename> <filename.c>\'94 and then ./filename and it compiles automatically. I guess the compiling process would be the program using header files such as stdio.h for standard input output and math.h for mathematics processing.\

4. I hope to gain a better knowledge on programming and computational thinking and brushing up my skills on C language also the matrix server is new to me so using command prompt/terminal would be a great way for me to learn to use the keyboard more and mouse less and get a better understanding of shell commands and servers of my computer. }
