1. My code achieves readability and maintainability primarily through consistent 
   indentation, variable naming and logical structure and comments.

2. Without the ability to nest loops and conditions, the code for this workshop 
   would experience several notable impacts:
   1- Code Repetition.
   2- Increased Complexity.
   3- Readability.
   4- Maintenance Challenges.
   5- Scalability Issues.
   basically without nesting the would become more repetitive less organized 
   and harder to read due to absence of structured
   conditional logic. 

3. Using a series of "if" statements instead of "if/else if.." chains is 
   inefficient because it leads to redundancy, complexity, hard readability 
   and unnecessary execution.
