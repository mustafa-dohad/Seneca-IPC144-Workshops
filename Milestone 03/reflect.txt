1. In this milestone, the development involved the creation of additional functions beyond the specified ones. 
   Three crucial functions were implemented, each serving a unique purpose:

    a) Function: "void viewAllAppointments(struct ClinicData *data);"
       Purpose: This function serves to print the contents of all appointments alongside their respective patient data.
       Value: Offering veterinary personnel an efficient method of time management, it provides a consolidated view of 
       daily appointments and their scheduled timings. This aids in scheduling and managing various patient processes, 
       contributing to overall operational efficiency.

    b) Function: "void addAppointment(struct Appointment appointment[], int maxAppointments, struct Patient *patient, int maxPatients)"
       Purpose: The purpose of this function is to enable users to input new schedules, ensuring data integrity through 
       validation steps.
       Value: This function is valuable for providing the capability to add new schedules without disrupting existing ones. 
       With robust validation steps, it minimizes the chances of errors, contributing to a more reliable and error-resistant system.

    c) Function: "void viewAppointmentSchedule(struct ClinicData *data)"
       Purpose: This function showcases appointments scheduled for a specific day based on user input.
       Value: Enhancing the user interface, it allows users to retrieve a comprehensive list of appointments on a specific day.
       The function contributes to organized data presentation, providing a focused overview of scheduled appointments for better patient care.

2. The limited usage of the "scanf" function in the client.c source code was intentional, with a deliberate effort to minimize 
   its occurrence. The primary reasons for this strategic decision include:

   Minimizing User Interaction: By reducing the number of "scanf" calls, the user experiences a smoother interaction with the 
   system, resulting in increased satisfaction and a streamlined user journey.

   Enhanced Program Manageability: A reduced number of "scanf" calls contribute to improved code manageability. Simplifying 
   user input handling makes the code easier to understand, modify, and maintain.

   Ensuring Data Integrity: Dedicated functions for different input types facilitate consistent and dependable data processing, 
   contributing to the overall integrity of the application's data.

3. For each of the functions created in question one, the decision regarding module placement was influenced by the following factors:

    a. "viewAllAppointmentsAllAppointments" Function:
       Module Placement: This function resides in the "Clinic Display Functions" module. The decision is based on the need to consolidate 
       display-related functions in one place, promoting readability and ease of maintenance.

    b. "viewAppointmentSchedule" Function:
       Module Placement: Integrated into the "Clinic Menu & Item Selection" module, this function logically belongs here as it constitutes 
       one of the menu choices. The module handles user selections, making it an appropriate location for functions associated with menu choices.

    c. "addAppointment" Function:
       Module Placement: Also placed in the "Clinic Menu & Item Selection" module, this function involves user input and interaction. 
       By keeping user interaction functions together, the code structure remains coherent, enhancing user experience and maintainability.
