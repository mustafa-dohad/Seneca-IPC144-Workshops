1. Benefit of Two Return Methods:
   - Positive:
    This feature increases flexibility by allowing users to choose how they want to 
    receive function outputs, either through return values or by modifying an argument. 
    This accommodates different programming styles and preferences, making the code more 
    adaptable to diverse use cases.

   - Negative: The dual return method may lead to confusion or misuse, as users might not 
   be clear about which method to rely on. This could potentially introduce bugs and make the code 
   less readable and maintainable. It may be challenging to enforce a consistent and clear usage pattern.

2. Cohesion and Coupling:
   - Less Than Perfect Cohesion:
    Function: processOrder
    Issue: This function might handle both order validation and email notification, which can be seen as 
    a violation of the single responsibility principle.
    Improvement: Split this function into two separate functions: one for order validation (validateOrder) 
    and another for sending email notifications (sendOrderNotification). This separation enhances cohesion
    by ensuring that each function has a clear and distinct responsibility.

   - Coupling Improvement:
    Function: updateCustomerInfo
    Issue: This function may directly interact with the customer database, creating a tight coupling between 
    the application logic and the data storage mechanism.
    Improvement: Create a separate function responsible for database interactions (e.g., updateDatabase) and 
    have updateCustomerInfo call this function. This way, the database logic is encapsulated, reducing the coupling 
    between the application logic and the database. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain, as changes 
    to the database won't directly impact the customer information update logic.

3. Advantages of Passing Structures:
   - Advantages:
    Passing structures to functions allows bundling related data together, promoting better organization and readability. 
    It reduces the number of function parameters, making the code cleaner. Additionally, it supports passing complex data 
    structures, enhancing the expressiveness of the code.

   - Efficiency Improvement:
    To make structure passing more efficient, consider using pointers to structures rather than passing structures by value.
    This minimizes the overhead of copying large structures, improving performance. Also, consider using const pointers if 
    the function does not need to modify the structure.

   - Improving "displayCatfoodData" Function:
    Instead of passing individual parameters for cat food data, pass a structure (e.g., `CatFoodData`) containing all relevant information.
    If the function only needs to read data and not modify it, use a const pointer to the structure to avoid unintentional modifications.
    Ensure that the structure is well-documented, specifying the expected fields and their meanings for clarity.
